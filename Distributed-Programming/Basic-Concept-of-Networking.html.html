      <h2 id="networking"><strong>Networking</strong> </h2>
      <h3 id="what-is-networking"><strong>What is Networking?</strong> </h3>
      <p>Networking is the process of connecting computers and other devices to enable communication, data sharing, and
            resource utilization. It plays a crucial role in modern computing, allowing individuals and organizations to
            operate efficiently.</p>
      <p>With the growing number of computers and devices, networking ensures they can communicate effectively. Enables
            local and global connectivity through wired (Ethernet) and wireless (Wi-Fi) technologies. The rise of cloud
            computing and the Internet of Things (IoT) further increases the need for robust network infrastructures.
      </p>
      <p>Networks allow seamless transmission of data between connected devices. Data can be transferred in various
            formats, including text, audio, video, and images. Protocols like TCP/IP, HTTP, and FTP define rules for
            data transmission over networks.</p>
      <p>Modern networks are no longer limited to just data transfer; they integrate multiple forms of communication:
      </p>
      <ul>
            <li><strong>Voice Communication</strong>: VoIP (Voice over IP) enables phone calls over the internet.</li>
            <li><strong>Video Streaming &amp; Conferencing</strong>: Services like Zoom and YouTube rely on high-speed
                  networks.</li>
            <li><strong>Image Sharing &amp; Multimedia Services</strong>: Applications like social media platforms
                  depend on networking to distribute content globally.<br>
                  This integration improves efficiency in business operations, entertainment, and remote collaboration.
            </li>
      </ul>
      <p>As businesses and technology evolve, networks need to scale to accommodate more users, devices, and services.
            <strong>Enterprise networks</strong> grow by adding more infrastructure, such as servers, routers, and
            cloud-based solutions. <strong>5G and fiber-optic technologies</strong> enhance the speed and capacity of
            modern networks.</p>
      <p>Networking is essential for enabling communication, data sharing, and integration of various digital services.
            As technology advances, networks continue to evolve, providing higher speeds, greater connectivity, and
            improved efficiency.</p>
      <h2 id="wide-area-network-wan"><strong>Wide Area Network (WAN)</strong> </h2>
      <h3 id="definition"><strong>Definition</strong>: </h3>
      <p>A <strong>Wide Area Network (WAN)</strong> is a communication network that spans a large geographic area, often
            connecting multiple <strong>Local Area Networks (LANs)</strong> or <strong>Metropolitan Area Networks
                  (MANs)</strong>. It enables organizations, businesses, and individuals to communicate and share data
            across long distances. WANs can be <strong>public</strong> (e.g., the Internet) or <strong>private</strong>
            (e.g., corporate networks using leased lines or VPNs).</p>
      <p>WANs are essential for businesses with multiple locations, enabling seamless communication, cloud computing,
            and centralized data access. They typically rely on service providers for infrastructure and may use
            satellite, fiber-optic, or cellular networks for connectivity.</p>
      <h3 id="technologies-used-in-wan"><strong>Technologies Used in WAN</strong>: </h3>
      <h4 id="1-circuit-switching"><strong>1. Circuit Switching</strong> </h4>
      <ul>
            <li>Establishes a <strong>dedicated communication path</strong> between two devices before data transfer
                  begins.</li>
            <li>Used in <strong>traditional telephone networks (PSTN - Public Switched Telephone Network)</strong>.</li>
            <li>Suitable for real-time voice communication but inefficient for data transmission since the dedicated
                  line remains open even when no data is being transmitted.</li>
            <li>Example: <strong>Landline phone calls</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="2-packet-switching"><strong>2. Packet Switching</strong> </h4>
      <ul>
            <li>Breaks data into <strong>packets</strong>, each of which can travel independently to the destination.
            </li>
            <li>More efficient than circuit switching, as network resources are shared dynamically.</li>
            <li>Common protocols: <strong>TCP/IP (used in the Internet), MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching)</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>Example: <strong>Internet communication, emails, web browsing</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="3-frame-relay"><strong>3. Frame Relay</strong> </h4>
      <ul>
            <li>A <strong>high-speed packet-switching technology</strong> that was popular before MPLS.</li>
            <li>Designed for transmitting <strong>variable-length frames</strong> efficiently over a WAN.</li>
            <li>Used primarily in corporate environments for <strong>connecting remote offices</strong> before being
                  largely replaced by newer technologies like MPLS and SD-WAN.</li>
            <li>Example: <strong>Early private corporate networks</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="4-asynchronous-transfer-mode-atm"><strong>4. Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)</strong> </h4>
      <ul>
            <li>A <strong>cell-switching technology</strong> that uses <strong>fixed-size cells (53 bytes each)</strong>
                  instead of variable-length packets.</li>
            <li>Ideal for <strong>real-time applications like video conferencing and voice transmission</strong>, as it
                  minimizes delays.</li>
            <li>Supports <strong>Quality of Service (QoS)</strong> for prioritizing different types of network traffic.
            </li>
            <li>Example: <strong>Used in early broadband networks, ISDN, and some telecommunications backbones</strong>.
            </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="local-area-network-lan"><strong>Local Area Network (LAN)</strong> </h2>
      <h3 id="definition-1"><strong>Definition</strong>: </h3>
      <p>A <strong>Local Area Network (LAN)</strong> is a high-speed network that connects computers and devices within
            a limited geographic area, such as a home, office, school, or data center. LANs are typically <strong>owned,
                  managed, and maintained by a single organization</strong>, providing <strong>fast, low-latency
                  communication</strong> between connected devices.</p>
      <p>LANs enable <strong>file sharing, resource sharing (printers, storage), and internet access</strong> for
            multiple users. They generally use <strong>Ethernet cables or wireless connections</strong> to establish
            connectivity.</p>
      <h3 id="technologies-used-in-lan"><strong>Technologies Used in LAN</strong>: </h3>
      <h4 id="1-switched-lans-eg-ethernet"><strong>1. Switched LANs (e.g., Ethernet)</strong> </h4>
      <ul>
            <li><strong>Ethernet (IEEE 802.3)</strong> is the dominant LAN technology, using <strong>switches and
                        routers</strong> to connect devices.</li>
            <li><strong>Switched LANs</strong> use <strong>network switches</strong> to direct data only to the intended
                  recipient, improving efficiency and reducing collisions compared to older <strong>hub-based
                        networks</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Fast Ethernet (100 Mbps)</strong>, <strong>Gigabit Ethernet (1 Gbps)</strong>, and
                  <strong>10-Gigabit Ethernet (10 Gbps)</strong> are common variations.</li>
            <li><strong>Topology</strong>: Mostly uses <strong>star topology</strong>, where all devices connect to a
                  central switch.</li>
            <li>Example: <strong>Corporate office networks, data centers</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="2-wireless-lans-wlans"><strong>2. Wireless LANs (WLANs)</strong> </h4>
      <ul>
            <li>Uses <strong>Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11)</strong> to provide wireless connectivity, allowing devices to connect
                  without physical cables.</li>
            <li><strong>Common standards</strong>:
                  <ul>
                        <li><strong>802.11n</strong> (Wi-Fi 4) – Up to 600 Mbps</li>

      <h3 id="definition-2"><strong>Definition</strong> </h3>
      <p>The <strong>Internet</strong> is a <strong>global network of interconnected computers</strong> that allows for
            the transmission of data, enabling communication, information exchange, and various online services. It is
            based on the <strong>TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)</strong> model, which
            standardizes communication between devices worldwide.</p>
      <p>The Internet enables services such as <strong>web browsing, email, file sharing, video streaming, and cloud
                  computing</strong>, making it a fundamental part of modern life.</p>
      <p>The internet works through a structured system where data is transmitted between devices using multiple layers
            of communication. Each layer plays a specific role in ensuring that data moves efficiently and accurately
            from the sender to the receiver.</p>
      <ol>
            <li>
                  <p><strong>User Interaction &amp; Data Processing</strong><br>
                        When you open a website or send a message, your device processes the request and converts it
                        into data. This step involves applications such as web browsers or messaging apps, which format
                        the data into a structure that can be transmitted.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                  <p><strong>Data Segmentation &amp; Organization</strong><br>
                        The formatted data is then divided into smaller packets and labeled with necessary information,
                        such as the order in which they should be reassembled. This ensures that large files or messages
                        can be sent in manageable pieces.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                  <p><strong>Addressing &amp; Identification</strong><br>
                        Each packet is assigned a source and destination address. This is similar to writing an address
                        on a letter, ensuring that the information reaches the intended recipient. Devices use unique
                        identifiers (IP addresses) to locate each other on the network.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                  <p><strong>Path Selection &amp; Routing</strong><br>
                        Once addressed, the packets are forwarded through a series of network devices (such as routers).
                        These devices determine the best path for each packet to travel based on network conditions,
                        ensuring efficient delivery.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                  <p><strong>Reliable Transmission &amp; Error Checking</strong><br>
                        As packets travel, they are monitored for errors and may be retransmitted if they get lost or
                        corrupted. This step ensures that the data received is accurate and complete, even if network
                        conditions are unstable.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                  <p><strong>Physical Transfer of Data</strong><br>
                        The packets are then converted into electrical signals, radio waves, or light pulses, depending
                        on the medium (Wi-Fi, fiber optic cables, or copper wires). These signals physically travel
                        across the network infrastructure to reach their destination.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                  <p><strong>Reconstruction &amp; Presentation</strong><br>
                        Once the packets arrive, they are reassembled in the correct order. The original request (such
                        as loading a webpage or displaying a message) is then reconstructed and presented to the user in
                        a human-readable format.</p>
            </li>
      </ol>
      <p>This structured approach allows the internet to function efficiently, handling billions of data transfers every
            second while ensuring reliability, security, and speed.</p>

      <h3 id="client-server-model">Client-Server Model </h3>
      <p>The <strong>Client-Server Model</strong> is a centralized architecture in which a client device requests
            resources or services from a dedicated server. The server is responsible for processing requests and
            responding accordingly. This model is widely used in web services, database management, and enterprise
            applications.</p>
      <h4 id="characteristics">Characteristics: </h4>
      <ul>
            <li><strong>Centralized Control</strong>: The server manages resources and services, ensuring data
                  consistency and security.</li>
            <li><strong>Scalability</strong>: Can support multiple clients, but server performance may become a
                  bottleneck.</li>
            <li><strong>Stateful or Stateless Communication</strong>: Some client-server interactions maintain session
                  states (e.g., HTTP with cookies), while others do not.</li>
            <li><strong>Security &amp; Authentication</strong>: Server enforces authentication and access control
                  mechanisms.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="workflow">Workflow: </h4>
      <ol>
            <li>The client establishes a connection with the server.</li>
            <li>The client sends a request (e.g., HTTP GET, SQL Query, File Access request).</li>
            <li>The server processes the request and retrieves the necessary resources.</li>
            <li>The server sends a response back to the client.</li>
            <li>The connection may persist (for stateful services) or terminate (for stateless services).</li>
      </ol>
      <h4 id="socket-communication">Socket Communication </h4>
      <p>The <strong>Client-Server Socket Model</strong> extends the traditional client-server approach by enabling
            bidirectional communication using sockets. Sockets provide an endpoint for sending and receiving data over a
            network using protocols like TCP or UDP.</p>

            <h5 id="analogy---apartment-doors">Analogy - Apartment Doors </h5>
            <p>Imagine you live in an apartment building, and each apartment has a <strong>door</strong> that allows people to
                  enter and exit. In the world of computer networks, this <strong>door</strong> represents a
                  <strong>socket</strong>, a communication endpoint that allows data to flow between different systems.</p>
            <h5 id="1-the-apartment-computerdevice"><strong>1. The Apartment (Computer/Device)</strong> </h5>
            <p>Each apartment represents a computer or a device in a network. Just like each apartment has its own entrance,
                  every computer has its own <strong>IP address</strong> (like an apartment number) that uniquely identifies
                  it.</p>
            <h5 id="2-the-door-socket"><strong>2. The Door (Socket)</strong> </h5>
            <p>The door of your apartment is the <strong>socket</strong>. It serves as the entry and exit point for
                  communication. Just like a door can be opened or closed, a socket can be <strong>opened</strong> to
                  send/receive data and <strong>closed</strong> when communication is done.</p>
            <h5 id="3-the-apartment-number--door-number-ip-address--port-number"><strong>3. The Apartment Number &amp; Door
                        Number (IP Address &amp; Port Number)</strong> </h5>
            <p>If someone wants to visit your apartment, they need to know your <strong>apartment number</strong> (IP
                  address). But in large apartments with multiple doors (for different purposes), they also need to know
                  <strong>which door to knock on</strong> (port number).</p>
            <p>For example:</p>
            <ul>
                  <li>Apartment (192.168.1.10)</li>
                  <li>Main Door (Port 80 for HTTP)</li>
                  <li>Back Door (Port 22 for SSH)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Different doors (ports) allow different types of visitors (network services).</p>
            <h5 id="4-communication-through-the-door-socket-connection"><strong>4. Communication Through the Door (Socket
                        Connection)</strong> </h5>
            <p>When a friend comes to visit, they <strong>knock on your door</strong> (send a request). If you're expecting
                  them, you <strong>open the door</strong> (establish a connection) and allow them inside.</p>
            <p>Similarly, in network communication:</p>
            <ul>
                  <li>A <strong>client</strong> sends a request to a <strong>server</strong> by "knocking" on a specific port.
                  </li>
                  <li>The <strong>server</strong> listens on that port and, if available, <strong>opens the socket</strong> to
                        establish a connection.</li>
                  <li>Data is exchanged through this open socket.</li>
                  <li>When finished, the socket is <strong>closed</strong>, just like a door can be locked after a visitor
                        leaves.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5 id="5-types-of-doors-tcp-vs-udp-sockets"><strong>5. Types of Doors (TCP vs. UDP Sockets)</strong> </h5>

                        <ul>
                              <li>Like a guarded entrance where guests must show ID before entering.</li>
                              <li>Ensures <strong>reliable</strong> communication by checking if messages are received

                        <ul>
                              <li>Like an open park entrance where people can come and go without verification.</li>
                              <li><strong>Faster but less reliable</strong>, as data may be lost in transmission.</li>
                              <li>Used for real-time applications like video streaming and gaming.</li>
                        </ul>
                  </li>
            </ul>
            <p>A <strong>socket</strong> is like a <strong>door</strong> that allows communication between devices. The
                  <strong>IP address</strong> is the apartment number, and the <strong>port number</strong> is the specific
                  door used for a particular service. Depending on whether it's a <strong>TCP socket</strong> (secure entry)
                  or <strong>UDP socket</strong> (fast but less reliable), the way data flows can differ.</p>

      <h5 id="characteristics-1">Characteristics: </h5>

                  <ul>
                        <li>The server creates a socket (e.g., TCP socket using
                              <code>socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0)</code>).</li>
                        <li>The server binds the socket to a port and listens for incoming connections
                              (<code>bind()</code>, <code>listen()</code>).</li>
                  </ul>

      <h3 id="peer-to-peer-p2p-model">Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Model </h3>
      <p>The <strong>Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Model</strong> is a decentralized network architecture where each node (peer)

            <li>Peers establish direct communication channels.</li>
            <li>Peers request and share resources dynamically.</li>

      </p>
      <h3 id="web-server"><strong>Web Server</strong> </h3>
      <p>A <strong>web server</strong> is a system that stores, processes, and delivers web pages to clients (browsers)
            over the Internet. It responds to HTTP(S) requests from clients and serves requested content, such as HTML
            files, images, videos, and scripts.</p>
      <h4 id="how-a-web-server-works"><strong>How a Web Server Works</strong> </h4>
      <ol>
            <li><strong>Receives Request:</strong> A client (browser) sends an HTTP request to the web server for a
                  specific resource (e.g., <code>https://example.com/index.html</code>).</li>
            <li><strong>Processes Request:</strong> The web server interprets the request and determines how to respond.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Retrieves Data:</strong> If the request is for a static file, the server fetches the file from

      <ul>
            <li>The browser sends an <strong>HTTP request</strong> to the web server.</li>

      <ul>
            <li>UDP <strong>does not establish a connection</strong> before sending data.</li>
            <li>Packets are sent independently without ensuring they arrive.</li>

      <h5 id="2-no-acknowledgments-or-retransmission"><strong>2. No Acknowledgments or Retransmission</strong> </h5>
      <ul>
            <li>UDP <strong>does not check if packets are received</strong> or in order.</li>
            <li>Lost packets are simply <strong>ignored, not retransmitted</strong>.</li>

      <h5 id="3-low-latency--high-speed"><strong>3. Low Latency &amp; High Speed</strong> </h5>
      <ul>
            <li>Since UDP doesn’t verify data arrival, it <strong>transmits data much faster than TCP.</strong></li>
            <li>Used when <strong>speed is more important than accuracy</strong> (e.g., live streaming).</li>

                  smoothly.</li>
            <li><strong>Live Streaming (YouTube, Twitch):</strong> Minor glitches are acceptable; speed is prioritized.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Voice &amp; Video Calls (VoIP, Zoom, Skype):</strong> Small packet loss doesn’t ruin the
                  conversation.</li>
            <li><strong>DNS (Domain Name System):</strong> Quick lookup requests without retransmission.</li>
